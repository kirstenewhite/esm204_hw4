Question # 1 

Estimate a quadratic damage function relating the dollar value of damages to the change in global mean temperature. Estimate a model with a zero intercept because damages by construction must equal zero when there is no climate change. Plot your estimated damage function, overlaid with a scatterplot of the underlying data.
